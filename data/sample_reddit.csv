iPhoneXR,1jcw0ib,Need Advice: Should I Repair My iPhone 11 and Keep Using My iPhone XR as a Secondary Phone or swap them?,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for some advice on my current iPhone situation.

I currently use two iPhones:

iPhone 11 (Primary Phone) – This has both my Oman numbers (personal and work). It has speaker issues (very low volume) and poor battery health (65%).
iPhone XR (Secondary Phone) – This has my Indian numbers and India-specific apps. I also use it for video calls at home on Wi-Fi. It has minor issues but better battery health (79%) and works fine for now.

I plan to buy a new non-Pro iPhone around October/November this year, but I can’t afford to replace both phones. I need to decide:

1. Should I repair the iPhone 11 (battery and speaker possibly) and keep it as my secondary phone when I get a new one?
2. Or should I just continue using the iPhone XR as my secondary device and retire the iPhone 11 once I get my new phone?
3. Should I temporarily swap usage between both phones until I upgrade, instead of repairing?

Would love to hear your thoughts on what would be the best long-term approach! 

Thanks in advance.",2025-03-16 21:18:06,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhoneXR/comments/1jcw0ib/need_advice_should_i_repair_my_iphone_11_and_keep/,I believe you should get the 11 repaired and retire the XR when you get a new phone in September.

source: every iphone XR user that updated to iOS 18.2","I updated to 18.2 from 17.7.2, and the device became hot and laggy. Then I erased all data and did a fresh install of 18.2 via iTunes. Everything is now very smooth, the battery life is excellent, and gaming feels more stable compared to previous versions."," I made the mistake of updating my XR to 18.2 two days ago, left the house with 92% battery, took one photo, wrote one Facebook post, spent 15 minutes on Facebook and texted one person and made an 8.42 minute call (spent on hold) and my battery was down to 23% when I returned home some 5 hours later.  Boy was this a mistake updating to IOS 18 on my XR.","I started w 18.1.1 and had some serious lag issues. e.g. Camera would freeze for 20-30 secs then take 2-3 pics based in my initial button pushes. Lots of other lags that made me want to throw my phone into the ground. After a bit it seemed to improve. Since upgrading to 18.2 performance is about on par with what 17 felt like. Battery drain is same. Current Max capacity is at 81%. One thing I  discovered when downloading 18.2 was that my 128GB storage was near maxed out (iOS told me it had to remove some lesser used apps to make room). 

I’d recently toggled Photos to keep all pics local on my phone (vs “optimizing” storage by keeping most pics on iCloud). I also had a ton of downloaded podcasts and music I wasn’t listening to so I freed up a ton of space. I’m guessing near maxed out storage was hurting performance. In any case my XR is working fine now w 18.2","i updated today fron 18.1.1 and performance wise is soo much smother, about the battery life atm i cant tell"

So,unless you are going to keep it for 7 years or so or care for AI,15 Plus would probably be more worth it since it has better battery life,bigger screen,same cameras as 16 and Dynamic island.","If you’re just going to upgrade, go for the latest. You’ll spend money anyway. Why not get the latest for longer support? Newer chipset and improved camera (a bit) 😁",If you value a bigger screen and amazing battery life the 15 Plus is totally worth it even a year after release. I upgraded to it from my XR and it’s been awesome. The battery is still at 100% health one year later. It can easily last me up to two days on a charge and the bigger screen is awesome for reading and watching videos. The 15 to 16 isn’t a huge difference a few little upgrades that we get every year but for the most part they are pretty similar. If you want the bigger phone definitely go for the 15 Plus otherwise get the regular size 16.,"Can you possibly save up for a 16 Plus? The 15 Plus isn't getting Apple Intelligence and the only phone to get that doesn't support Apple Intelligence these days would be an iPhone 13 mini. Any other phone older than the iPhone 16 series other than the 15 Pro and Pro Max is not worth getting anymore thanks to the devices not having Apple Intelligence. The 13 Mini is the only exception because Apple hasn't made another phone of that size, and the 12 Mini is not excluded because the 13 Mini exists. So yeah, get the iPhone 16 or try to save for the 16 Plus, don't get the 15 Plus and especially don't get the 15."

Are you good at taking things apart and putting them back together? I’d say the most important things:

- Read the instructions once or twice, from beginning to end so you know what will be involved. 
- go slow and be patient. The screws and parts you’ll be working with are VERY small and you can easily drop or lose things. 

 This is easily doable if you buy a kit with good instructions. I used an ifixit kit that came with the tools. If the instructions say it takes an hour, it’ll take you more than twice that.

Because with the AI thing coming, very soon old devices will become slow and software support might go out.","Buy the newer always. If you can afford a 16, then why even think about older models. Same with 15. How can you even think about ip13 if you can buy anything newer",Depends on how much money you want to spend.

I always used this iTunes instead of Store Version if you are on Windows PC.  (You will get proper drivers automatically) [https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64)

iPhone13,1k04r3h,Is it worth it to upgrade to the iphone 16 or 16 pro ?,"I've had my iPhone 13 for about two years now, and even though the battery is at 88%, it's still performing really well—in fact, I think it’s one of the best iPhone releases so far, especially with the gorgeous green color that I absolutely love. My brother, who’s in his final year of high school, currently uses a really low-end Xiaomi phone, and I’ve been thinking it might be a good time to get him something better since he used to have an iPhone 6s and really liked it. That’s when it hit me—why not give him my iPhone 13 and upgrade myself to the upcoming iPhone 16 or 16 Pro? I’ve had a Samsung with a 120Hz display before (which I passed on to my sister), and I remember how smooth that experience was, so when I switched back to the iPhone 13, I definitely noticed the difference. So now I'm torn: should I just buy my brother a used iPhone 11 or 12 and keep using the iPhone 13 myself, or should I go ahead and treat myself to the iPhone 16 or 16 Pro—depending on whether the base model is worth it—and give him my current 13? I’m wondering if the jump from the 13 to the 16 will be noticeable enough to justify the upgrade.",2025-04-15 22:18:20,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone13/comments/1k04r3h/is_it_worth_it_to_upgrade_to_the_iphone_16_or_16/,"Silicon carbide battery and camera updates are worth waiting
Maybe 1-2 years","I had a green 13 and upgraded to a 16 pro because my carrier had a deal on, actually saved about $25 a month with a new phone. While it is an upgrade it’s not a big one. The 16p takes better pictures, runs smoother, the action button and camera buttons I use a lot more than I thought I would but I miss my green phone lol","We have 13s, had upgraded from 6s, we keep our iPhones until the OS can be updated anymore.","I used an iPhone 15 PM at work today and the difference in smoothness is unreal

It’s so fluid and seamless, I enjoyed just browsing the damn settings 😂

if you can afford it, do it",The upgrade from 13 to 16 pro would be worth it. If you can afford it I would do it
iPhoneXR,1ja4jzl,IOS 18.3 Works totally fine with me,"So I read some stuff here others having laggy problems and some bugs with their phone, but I actually haven't experienced any one of these.
I also loved the update the customization you can do from the lock screen/home-screen is great. Unlike before I had to use shortcuts to make my phone look different which requires a lot of time.
